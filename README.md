------------------------------------------------------------------------
The background of this project is set in the future when people discover 
many habitable planets in cosmic exploration. In order for everyone to 
have a life that suits for them, each planet will have fixed requirements 
for habitation. This project can collect people's application requirements 
and determine whether they are suitable for living on the planet they want 
to go to. If applicants are rejected by the planet they want to go to, 
this program can help them find a planet that suits them and recommend 
it to them.
